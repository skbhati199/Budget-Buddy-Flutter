# Budget Buddy

Developing a budget tracking app

## Getting Started

- The app displays the total budget and current spending on the BudgetScreen.
- The user can navigate to the AddSpendingScreen to input and add a new spending amount.
- The entered spending amount is passed back to the BudgetScreen, and the current spending is updated accordingly.
